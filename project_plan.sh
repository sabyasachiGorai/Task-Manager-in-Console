A Pproject using C++ specifiaclly OOP and LinkedList data structur:

Project Title:      Task Manager in Console

IDEA:   Develop a program to take task for user as input and save in linkedlist data structure also save the data to a file and if required fetch it from a file

Advancement:     Intially only prject name and project id later make it more robust by integrating 
            - duedate 
            - save task in file fetch from a file if required
            - priority 
            - sort accroding to priority
            - view pending task
            - mark tasks as completed
            - etc.

Now Work on:
    # - create the structure of the node
    # - create a task i.e input from the user
    # - delete it by id
    # - print 
    # - proper user input
    # - print in proper table format
Now Work on:
    # - sort them by Id
        --> also can be implemnted by priority queue but implemnted sorting 
        # LL mergesort
        # merge to sorted LL # <-- to do 
        # find mid of a LL
    - save to file  #<-- file  
    - fetch from file

Now work on:
    - work on additional features
    - alternate two switch case except if else


# NEW LEARNINGS
-> pointer in depth
-> iomanip
    - setw
-> merge two sorted array
-> merge sort
-> merge two sorted list
-> find mid of the list
-> merge sort in list
