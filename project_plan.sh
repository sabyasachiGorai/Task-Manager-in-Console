A Pproject using C++ specifiaclly OOP and LinkedList data structur:

Project Title:      Task Manager in Console

IDEA:   Develop a program to take task for user as input and save in linkedlist data structure also save the data to a file and if required fetch it from a file

Advancement:     Intialli only prject name and project id later make it more robust by integrating 
            - duedate 
            - save task in file fetch from a file if required
            - priority 
            - sort accrofing to pririty
            - view pending task
            - mark tasks as completed
            - etc.

Now Work on:
    # - create the structure of the node
    # - create a task i.e input from the user
    # - delete it by id
    # - print
    # - proper user input
Now Work on:
    - sort them by Id
    - save to file
    - fetch from file

Now work on:
    - work on additional features
